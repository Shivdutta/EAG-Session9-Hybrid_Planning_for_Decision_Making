In its annual report for 2012, the company summarizes its business operations: We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We own our sales and service network and have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers. We are the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, which achieves a market-leading range on a single charge combined with attractive design, driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions. As of December 31, 2012, we had delivered approximately 2,450 Tesla Roadsters to customers in over 30 countries. While we have concluded the production run of the Tesla Roadster, its proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our business. We modified this system for our Model S sedan and plan to continue to enhance it for use in our future electric vehicles, including our Model X crossover. [1] The company notes that ‘the commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric vehicle that meets consumers’ range and performance expectations requires substantial design, engineering, and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles’. [2] Tesla Motors makes much of its inventive labour force: ‘Our roots in Silicon Valley have enabled us to recruit engineers with strong skills in electrical engineering, power electronics and 1 Tesla Motors, ‘Annual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012’, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 2 Ibid. 2 software engineering’. [3] The company observes: ‘We believe these capabilities, coupled with our focus solely on electric vehicle technology as well as our strong in-house engineering and manufacturing capacity, will enable us to sustain the electric vehicle industry leadership we created through the production of the Tesla Roadster and Model S.’ [4] The chief executive officer and product architect of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk has established a reputation for being an innovative entrepreneur, across a range of technological fields, including information technology, clean technology, electric cars, and spacecraft. His Tesla Motors’ biography gives a sense of this diverse array of interests: At Tesla, Elon has overseen product development and design from the beginning, including the all electric Tesla Roadster, Model S and Model X. Transitioning to a sustainable energy economy, in which electric vehicles play a pivotal role, has been one of his central interests for almost two decades, stemming from his time as a physics student working on ultracapacitors in Silicon Valley. At SpaceX, Elon is the chief designer, overseeing development of\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_0]', annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text=\"rockets and spacecraft for missions to Earth orbit and ultimately to other planets… In addition, Elon is the non-executive chairman and principal shareholder of SolarCity, which he helped create. SolarCity is now the leading provider of solar power systems in the United States. Prior to SpaceX, Elon co-founded PayPal, the world's leading Internet payment system, and served as the company's Chairman and CEO. Before PayPal, Mr. Musk co-founded Zip2, a provider of Internet software to the media industry. [5] 3 Ibid. 4 Ibid. 5 Telsa Motors, ‘Executives: Elon Musk’, http://www.teslamotors.com/executives 3 Musk has shown a particular interest in the impact of disruptive technologies upon established business models. There are also striking synergies between his various ventures. Tesla Motors is reinforced by such infrastructure projects as SolarCity [6] and the Gigafactory. [7] Traditionally, Tesla Motors had professed to take a strict approach to the protection of intellectual property. In 2012, the company observed: ‘Our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties.’ [8] Tesla Motors warned: Any failure to protect our proprietary rights adequately could result in our competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in the loss of some of our competitive advantage and a decrease in our revenue which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. We have also received from third parties patent licenses related to manufacturing our vehicles. [9] The strategy of the company was to rely upon a combination of patent law, and other intellectual property rights, to protect the core technology of the company. 6 SolarCity, http://www.solarcity.com/company/team 7 Tesla Motors, ‘Gigafactory’, 26 February 2014, http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/gigafactory 8 Tesla Motors, ‘Annual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012’, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 9 Ibid. 4 On the 12th June 2014, Elon Musk, the chief executive officer of the electric car manufacturer, Tesla Motors, announced in a blog that ‘all our patents belong to you.’ [10] He explained that the company would adopt an open source philosophy in respect of its intellectual property in order to encourage the development of the industry of electric cars, and address the carbon crisis. Elon Musk made the dramatic, landmark announcement: Yesterday, there was a wall of Tesla patents in the lobby of our Palo Alto headquarters. That is no longer the case. They have been removed, in the spirit of the open source movement, for the advancement of electric vehicle technology. [11] Elon Musk observed that ‘Tesla Motors was created to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport.’ [12] He maintained: ‘If we clear a path to the creation of compelling electric vehicles, but then lay intellectual property landmines\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_1]\", annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text=\"out that on our track it would run out after just 55 miles and if it does run out, it is not a quick job to charge it up again.’ [160] Tesla Motors pleaded that there had been libel and malicious falsehood. The British Courts were sceptical of such claims. In the Court of Appeals, Lord Moore-Bick observed: ‘In my view the case pleaded in support of the claim for special damages is, to say the least, very thin on its own terms’. [161] He commented: ‘Moreover, on the basis of the material currently before the court I do not think that there is any real prospect of Tesla's being able to demonstrate at trial that it has suffered any quantifiable loss by reason of any of the actionable statements.’ [162] http://www.afr.com/p/marketing/chinese _ trademark _ squatters _ have _ ABq1XbD3mSTQMiWicm38PO and Kim Lester, ‘Penfolds, Tesla, and Apple: Trade Mark Squatting in China’, Drive, ABC 666 Radio, 16 July 2014. 158 Jess Collen, ‘Tesla's Trademark Problems In China Are Hardly Electrifying News’, *Forbes*, 7 July 2014, http://www.bloomberg.com/new s /2 0 1 4- 07 - 07/tesla - sued - in - china - for - trademark - infringement.html 159 *Tesla Motors Ltd & Anor* v *British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)* [2013] EWCA Civ 152 (05 March 2013) 160 Ibid. 161 Ibid. 162 Ibid. 41 There has also been a conflict over defamation and contract law between Martin Eberhard, one of the founders of Tesla Motors, and its current CEO, Elon Musk. [163] Musk has denied that Eberhard was the inventor of Tesla, claiming ‘he had no technology of his own, he did not have a prototype and he owned no intellectual property relating to electric cars.’ [164] **5.** **Sustainable Transportation, Clean Technology, and Climate Change** In his address, Elon Musk emphasized the need to build clean technologies to address the problem of climate change. He observed: ‘Given that annual new vehicle production is approaching 100 million per year and the global fleet is approximately 2 billion cars, it is impossible for Tesla to build electric cars fast enough to address the carbon crisis.’ Musk recognised: ‘By the same token, it means the market is enormous.’ [ 165] He maintained: ‘Our true competition is not the small trickle of non-Tesla electric cars being produced, but rather the enormous flood of gasoline cars pouring out of the world’s factories every day.’ [166] Musk commented that there was a need to develop the innovation ecology in respect of electric cars: ‘We believe that Tesla, other companies making electric cars, and the world would all benefit from a common, rapidly-evolving technology platform.’ [167] 163 Eric Lane, ‘Roadster Rage: Tesla Founder Sues CEO for Defamation; Alleges Tesla Breached - Contracts’, *The Green Patent Blog*, 28 June 2009, http://www.greenpatentblog.com/2009/06/28/roadster rage tesla - founder - sues - ceo - for - defamation - alleges - tesla - breached - contracts/ 164 Ucilia Wang, ‘Tesla’s Elon Musk Rebuts Claims by Martin Eberhard’, Greentech Media, 22 June 2009, http://www.greentechmedia.com /a rt ic l e s/read/teslas - elon - musk - rebuts - claims -\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_20]\", annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text='Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012’, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 29 Ibid. 12 property rights or for other reasons.’ [30] The company also noted that ‘the costs associated with enforcing patents, confidentiality and invention agreements or other intellectual property rights may make aggressive enforcement impracticable.’ [31] Tesla Motors was also aware that ‘current and future competitors may independently develop similar technology, duplicate our vehicles or design new vehicles in a way that circumvents our patents.’ [32] Tesla Motors admitted that ‘The status of patents involves complex legal and factual questions and the breadth of claims allowed is uncertain’. [33] The company was also conscious: ‘In addition, patents issued to us may be infringed upon or designed around by others and others may obtain patents that we need to license or design around, either of which would increase costs and may adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.’ [34] Such reservations are an important context for the announcement in 2014.

In its annual report for 2012, the company summarizes its business operations: We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We own our sales and service network and have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers. We are the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, which achieves a market-leading range on a single charge combined with attractive design, driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions. As of December 31, 2012, we had delivered approximately 2,450 Tesla Roadsters to customers in over 30 countries. While we have concluded the production run of the Tesla Roadster, its proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our business. We modified this system for our Model S sedan and plan to continue to enhance it for use in our future electric vehicles, including our Model X crossover. [1] The company notes that ‘the commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric vehicle that meets consumers’ range and performance expectations requires substantial design, engineering, and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles’. [2] Tesla Motors makes much of its inventive labour force: ‘Our roots in Silicon Valley have enabled us to recruit engineers with strong skills in electrical engineering, power electronics and 1 Tesla Motors, ‘Annual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012’, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 2 Ibid. 2 software engineering’. [3] The company observes: ‘We believe these capabilities, coupled with our focus solely on electric vehicle technology as well as our strong in-house engineering and manufacturing capacity, will enable us to sustain the electric vehicle industry leadership we created through the production of the Tesla Roadster and Model S.’ [4] The chief executive officer and product architect of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk has established a reputation for being an innovative entrepreneur, across a range of technological fields, including information technology, clean technology, electric cars, and spacecraft. His Tesla Motors’ biography gives a sense of this diverse array of interests: At Tesla, Elon has overseen product development and design from the beginning, including the all electric Tesla Roadster, Model S and Model X. Transitioning to a sustainable energy economy, in which electric vehicles play a pivotal role, has been one of his central interests for almost two decades, stemming from his time as a physics student working on ultracapacitors in Silicon Valley. At SpaceX, Elon is the chief designer, overseeing development of\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_0]', annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text=\"rockets and spacecraft for missions to Earth orbit and ultimately to other planets… In addition, Elon is the non-executive chairman and principal shareholder of SolarCity, which he helped create. SolarCity is now the leading provider of solar power systems in the United States. Prior to SpaceX, Elon co-founded PayPal, the world's leading Internet payment system, and served as the company's Chairman and CEO. Before PayPal, Mr. Musk co-founded Zip2, a provider of Internet software to the media industry. [5] 3 Ibid. 4 Ibid. 5 Telsa Motors, ‘Executives: Elon Musk’, http://www.teslamotors.com/executives 3 Musk has shown a particular interest in the impact of disruptive technologies upon established business models. There are also striking synergies between his various ventures. Tesla Motors is reinforced by such infrastructure projects as SolarCity [6] and the Gigafactory. [7] Traditionally, Tesla Motors had professed to take a strict approach to the protection of intellectual property. In 2012, the company observed: ‘Our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties.’ [8] Tesla Motors warned: Any failure to protect our proprietary rights adequately could result in our competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in the loss of some of our competitive advantage and a decrease in our revenue which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. We have also received from third parties patent licenses related to manufacturing our vehicles. [9] The strategy of the company was to rely upon a combination of patent law, and other intellectual property rights, to protect the core technology of the company. 6 SolarCity, http://www.solarcity.com/company/team 7 Tesla Motors, ‘Gigafactory’, 26 February 2014, http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/gigafactory 8 Tesla Motors, ‘Annual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012’, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 9 Ibid. 4 On the 12th June 2014, Elon Musk, the chief executive officer of the electric car manufacturer, Tesla Motors, announced in a blog that ‘all our patents belong to you.’ [10] He explained that the company would adopt an open source philosophy in respect of its intellectual property in order to encourage the development of the industry of electric cars, and address the carbon crisis. Elon Musk made the dramatic, landmark announcement: Yesterday, there was a wall of Tesla patents in the lobby of our Palo Alto headquarters. That is no longer the case. They have been removed, in the spirit of the open source movement, for the advancement of electric vehicle technology. [11] Elon Musk observed that ‘Tesla Motors was created to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport.’ [12] He maintained: ‘If we clear a path to the creation of compelling electric vehicles, but then lay intellectual property landmines\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_1]\", annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text=\"out that on our track it would run out after just 55 miles and if it does run out, it is not a quick job to charge it up again.’ [160] Tesla Motors pleaded that there had been libel and malicious falsehood. The British Courts were sceptical of such claims. In the Court of Appeals, Lord Moore-Bick observed: ‘In my view the case pleaded in support of the claim for special damages is, to say the least, very thin on its own terms’. [161] He commented: ‘Moreover, on the basis of the material currently before the court I do not think that there is any real prospect of Tesla's being able to demonstrate at trial that it has suffered any quantifiable loss by reason of any of the actionable statements.’ [162] http://www.afr.com/p/marketing/chinese _ trademark _ squatters _ have _ ABq1XbD3mSTQMiWicm38PO and Kim Lester, ‘Penfolds, Tesla, and Apple: Trade Mark Squatting in China’, Drive, ABC 666 Radio, 16 July 2014. 158 Jess Collen, ‘Tesla's Trademark Problems In China Are Hardly Electrifying News’, *Forbes*, 7 July 2014, http://www.bloomberg.com/new s /2 0 1 4- 07 - 07/tesla - sued - in - china - for - trademark - infringement.html 159 *Tesla Motors Ltd & Anor* v *British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)* [2013] EWCA Civ 152 (05 March 2013) 160 Ibid. 161 Ibid. 162 Ibid. 41 There has also been a conflict over defamation and contract law between Martin Eberhard, one of the founders of Tesla Motors, and its current CEO, Elon Musk. [163] Musk has denied that Eberhard was the inventor of Tesla, claiming ‘he had no technology of his own, he did not have a prototype and he owned no intellectual property relating to electric cars.’ [164] **5.** **Sustainable Transportation, Clean Technology, and Climate Change** In his address, Elon Musk emphasized the need to build clean technologies to address the problem of climate change. He observed: ‘Given that annual new vehicle production is approaching 100 million per year and the global fleet is approximately 2 billion cars, it is impossible for Tesla to build electric cars fast enough to address the carbon crisis.’ Musk recognised: ‘By the same token, it means the market is enormous.’ [ 165] He maintained: ‘Our true competition is not the small trickle of non-Tesla electric cars being produced, but rather the enormous flood of gasoline cars pouring out of the world’s factories every day.’ [166] Musk commented that there was a need to develop the innovation ecology in respect of electric cars: ‘We believe that Tesla, other companies making electric cars, and the world would all benefit from a common, rapidly-evolving technology platform.’ [167] 163 Eric Lane, ‘Roadster Rage: Tesla Founder Sues CEO for Defamation; Alleges Tesla Breached - Contracts’, *The Green Patent Blog*, 28 June 2009, http://www.greenpatentblog.com/2009/06/28/roadster rage tesla - founder - sues - ceo - for - defamation - alleges - tesla - breached - contracts/ 164 Ucilia Wang, ‘Tesla’s Elon Musk Rebuts Claims by Martin Eberhard’, Greentech Media, 22 June 2009, http://www.greentechmedia.com /a rt ic l e s/read/teslas - elon - musk - rebuts - claims -\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_20]\", annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text='Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012’, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 29 Ibid. 12 property rights or for other reasons.’ [30] The company also noted that ‘the costs associated with enforcing patents, confidentiality and invention agreements or other intellectual property rights may make aggressive enforcement impracticable.’ [31] Tesla Motors was also aware that ‘current and future competitors may independently develop similar technology, duplicate our vehicles or design new vehicles in a way that circumvents our patents.’ [32] Tesla Motors admitted that ‘The status of patents involves complex legal and factual questions and the breadth of claims allowed is uncertain’. [33] The company was also conscious: ‘In addition, patents issued to us may be infringed upon or designed around by others and others may obtain patents that we need to license or design around, either of which would increase costs and may adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.’ [34] Such reservations are an important context for the announcement in 2014. In his blog post in 2014, Elon Musk of Tesla Motors discussed his growing disenchantment with the patent system: When I started out with my first company, Zip2, I thought patents were a good thing and worked hard to obtain them. And maybe they were good long ago, but too often these days they serve merely to stifle progress, entrench the positions of giant corporations and enrich those in the legal profession, rather than the actual inventors. After Zip2, when I realized that receiving a patent really just meant that you bought a lottery ticket to a lawsuit, I avoided them whenever possible.
