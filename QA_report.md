🌟 Bug Report: Decision Layer & Memory Integration Magic ✨

🐞 Previously Encountered Glitches
❌ Decision Layer Blind Spots
It couldn’t see or use outputs from the perception layer or memory, leading to poor, uninformed decisions.

🧠 Lost Tool Wisdom
Valuable tool outputs weren’t stored in memory—meaning key insights vanished into the void and couldn’t help with future queries.

🚀 Power-Up: New & Improved Workflow

🔍 1. Memory Lookup First
🧠 Before diving into processing, the system now checks memory for a relevant past answer.
✅ This speeds up responses and prevents redundant work!

👁️ 2. Perception Layer Activation
If memory holds no gold, the system sends the query to the perception layer.
🔬 Here, the query is analyzed using tools/models to generate responses or insights.

🧭 3. Context-Packed Handoff
The original query plus the perception output go to the decision layer,
ensuring it sees the full picture 📸 and not just pieces of the puzzle.

🧠 4. Smarter Decisions, Every Time
The decision layer now acts with clarity and insight,
choosing whether to:
- 💡 Provide an answer
- 🛠️ Invoke more tools
- ❓ Ask for more information

💾 5. Saving the Magic: Memory Updated
Any outputs from tools are now automatically stored in memory.
📚 This means:
- The system gets smarter over time 🧠
- Future queries benefit from today’s work 🔁
- Both perception & decision layers gain from this newfound wisdom 🪄

🌈 Result: A more responsive, smarter, and memory-powered system.
Say goodbye to blind spots and lost insights. Say hello to intelligent decision-making! 🚀
