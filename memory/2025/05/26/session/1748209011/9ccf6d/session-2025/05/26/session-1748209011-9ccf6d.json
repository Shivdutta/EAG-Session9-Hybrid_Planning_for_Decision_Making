This system essentially allows owner to pre-cool or pre-heat the cabin of a plugged-in Model S. Of course, this is a feature that we\u2019re sure all Model S owners use on almost a daily basis. However, there may be an issue that could prevent Model S owners from accessing this feature in the future. It seems Tesla\u2019s remote access system may infringe upon a patent held by pointSET. [41] On the 30th April 2013, an attorney for pointSET sent a letter to Tesla Motors, alleging that \u2018Tesla induces infringement of claim 6 of United States Patent No. 7,379,541.\u2019 [42] The patent concerned a \u2018method and apparatus for setting programmable features of a motor vehicle.\u2019 43 The letter stated that \u2018pointSET is offering a one-time, fully-paid licensing flat fee of $500,000' that \u2018will cover both past and future use of the technology.\u2019 [44] In response, Tesla Motors sought a declaratory judgment of patent non-infringement in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. [45] Tesla Motors requested a judgment that \u2018Tesla does not infringe and has not infringed, directly or indirectly, the \u2018541 patent.\u2019 [46] Tesla Motors also asked for a ruling that \u2018the Model S Beta app does not infringe and has not infringed, directly or indirectly, the \u2018541 patent.\u2019 [47] Tesla Motors requested that 41 Eric Loveday, \u2018Tesla in Patent Dispute with pointSET over How Automaker Remotely Controls Cabin Temperature of Model S\u2019, Inside EVs, 2013, http://insideevs.com/tesla - in - patent - dispute - with - pointset - over how - automaker - remotely - controls - cabin - temperature - of - model - s/ 42 Ibid. 43 Ibid. 44 Ibid. 45 *Tesla Motors Inc.* v *Pointset Corporation*, United States District Court for the Northern District of California (2013) http://pdfserver.amlaw.com/ca/TESLAsuit.pdf 46 Ibid. 47 Ibid. 15 \u2018pointSET, and all persons acting on its behalf or in concert with it, be permanently enjoined and restrained from charging, orally or in writing, that the \u2018514 patent is infringed, directly or indirectly, by Tesla or the Model S Beta app.\u2019 [48] The company asked that \u2018Tesla be awarded its costs, expenses and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees in this action\u2019. [49] Moreover, the company asked that \u2018Tesla be awarded such other and further relief as the Court may deem appropriate.\u2019 [50] Such disputes are not uncommon. In my 2011 book *Intellectual Property and Climate* *Change: Inventing Clean Technologies,* I considered the significant patent litigation in respect of green cars and transportation. [51] There was an epic dispute between Paice LLC and Toyota Motors over patents regarding hybrid cars, such as the Toyota Prius.

In its annual report for 2012, the company summarizes its business operations: We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We own our sales and service network and have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers. We are the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, which achieves a market-leading range on a single charge combined with attractive design, driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions. As of December 31, 2012, we had delivered approximately 2,450 Tesla Roadsters to customers in over 30 countries. While we have concluded the production run of the Tesla Roadster, its proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our business. We modified this system for our Model S sedan and plan to continue to enhance it for use in our future electric vehicles, including our Model X crossover. [1] The company notes that \u2018the commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric vehicle that meets consumers\u2019 range and performance expectations requires substantial design, engineering, and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles\u2019. [2] Tesla Motors makes much of its inventive labour force: \u2018Our roots in Silicon Valley have enabled us to recruit engineers with strong skills in electrical engineering, power electronics and 1 Tesla Motors, \u2018Annual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012\u2019, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 2 Ibid. 2 software engineering\u2019. [3] The company observes: \u2018We believe these capabilities, coupled with our focus solely on electric vehicle technology as well as our strong in-house engineering and manufacturing capacity, will enable us to sustain the electric vehicle industry leadership we created through the production of the Tesla Roadster and Model S.\u2019 [4] The chief executive officer and product architect of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk has established a reputation for being an innovative entrepreneur, across a range of technological fields, including information technology, clean technology, electric cars, and spacecraft. His Tesla Motors\u2019 biography gives a sense of this diverse array of interests: At Tesla, Elon has overseen product development and design from the beginning, including the all electric Tesla Roadster, Model S and Model X. Transitioning to a sustainable energy economy, in which electric vehicles play a pivotal role, has been one of his central interests for almost two decades, stemming from his time as a physics student working on ultracapacitors in Silicon Valley. At SpaceX, Elon is the chief designer, overseeing development of\\\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_0]\\', annotations=None), TextContent(type=\\'text\\', text=\"rockets and spacecraft for missions to Earth orbit and ultimately to other planets\u2026 In addition, Elon is the non-executive chairman and principal shareholder of SolarCity, which he helped create. SolarCity is now the leading provider of solar power systems in the United States. Prior to SpaceX, Elon co-founded PayPal, the world\\'s leading Internet payment system, and served as the company\\'s Chairman and CEO. Before PayPal, Mr. Musk co-founded Zip2, a provider of Internet software to the media industry. [5] 3 Ibid. 4 Ibid. 5 Telsa Motors, \u2018Executives: Elon Musk\u2019, http://www.teslamotors.com/executives 3 Musk has shown a particular interest in the impact of disruptive technologies upon established business models. There are also striking synergies between his various ventures. Tesla Motors is reinforced by such infrastructure projects as SolarCity [6] and the Gigafactory. [7] Traditionally, Tesla Motors had professed to take a strict approach to the protection of intellectual property. In 2012, the company observed: \u2018Our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties.\u2019 [8] Tesla Motors warned: Any failure to protect our proprietary rights adequately could result in our competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in the loss of some of our competitive advantage and a decrease in our revenue which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. We have also received from third parties patent licenses related to manufacturing our vehicles. [9] The strategy of the company was to rely upon a combination of patent law, and other intellectual property rights, to protect the core technology of the company. 6 SolarCity, http://www.solarcity.com/company/team 7 Tesla Motors, \u2018Gigafactory\u2019, 26 February 2014, http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/gigafactory 8 Tesla Motors, \u2018Annual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012\u2019, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 9 Ibid. 4 On the 12th June 2014, Elon Musk, the chief executive officer of the electric car manufacturer, Tesla Motors, announced in a blog that \u2018all our patents belong to you.\u2019 [10] He explained that the company would adopt an open source philosophy in respect of its intellectual property in order to encourage the development of the industry of electric cars, and address the carbon crisis. Elon Musk made the dramatic, landmark announcement: Yesterday, there was a wall of Tesla patents in the lobby of our Palo Alto headquarters. That is no longer the case. They have been removed, in the spirit of the open source movement, for the advancement of electric vehicle technology. [11] Elon Musk observed that \u2018Tesla Motors was created to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport.\u2019 [12] He maintained: \u2018If we clear a path to the creation of compelling electric vehicles, but then lay intellectual property landmines\\\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_1]\", annotations=None), TextContent(type=\\'text\\', text=\"out that on our track it would run out after just 55 miles and if it does run out, it is not a quick job to charge it up again.\u2019 [160] Tesla Motors pleaded that there had been libel and malicious falsehood. The British Courts were sceptical of such claims. In the Court of Appeals, Lord Moore-Bick observed: \u2018In my view the case pleaded in support of the claim for special damages is, to say the least, very thin on its own terms\u2019. [161] He commented: \u2018Moreover, on the basis of the material currently before the court I do not think that there is any real prospect of Tesla\\'s being able to demonstrate at trial that it has suffered any quantifiable loss by reason of any of the actionable statements.\u2019 [162] http://www.afr.com/p/marketing/chinese _ trademark _ squatters _ have _ ABq1XbD3mSTQMiWicm38PO and Kim Lester, \u2018Penfolds, Tesla, and Apple: Trade Mark Squatting in China\u2019, Drive, ABC 666 Radio, 16 July 2014. 158 Jess Collen, \u2018Tesla\\'s Trademark Problems In China Are Hardly Electrifying News\u2019, *Forbes*, 7 July 2014, http://www.bloomberg.com/new s /2 0 1 4- 07 - 07/tesla - sued - in - china - for - trademark - infringement.html 159 *Tesla Motors Ltd & Anor* v *British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)* [2013] EWCA Civ 152 (05 March 2013) 160 Ibid. 161 Ibid. 162 Ibid. 41 There has also been a conflict over defamation and contract law between Martin Eberhard, one of the founders of Tesla Motors, and its current CEO, Elon Musk. [163] Musk has denied that Eberhard was the inventor of Tesla, claiming \u2018he had no technology of his own, he did not have a prototype and he owned no intellectual property relating to electric cars.\u2019 [164] **5.** **Sustainable Transportation, Clean Technology, and Climate Change** In his address, Elon Musk emphasized the need to build clean technologies to address the problem of climate change. He observed: \u2018Given that annual new vehicle production is approaching 100 million per year and the global fleet is approximately 2 billion cars, it is impossible for Tesla to build electric cars fast enough to address the carbon crisis.\u2019 Musk recognised: \u2018By the same token, it means the market is enormous.\u2019 [ 165] He maintained: \u2018Our true competition is not the small trickle of non-Tesla electric cars being produced, but rather the enormous flood of gasoline cars pouring out of the world\u2019s factories every day.\u2019 [166] Musk commented that there was a need to develop the innovation ecology in respect of electric cars: \u2018We believe that Tesla, other companies making electric cars, and the world would all benefit from a common, rapidly-evolving technology platform.\u2019 [167] 163 Eric Lane, \u2018Roadster Rage: Tesla Founder Sues CEO for Defamation; Alleges Tesla Breached - Contracts\u2019, *The Green Patent Blog*, 28 June 2009, http://www.greenpatentblog.com/2009/06/28/roadster rage tesla - founder - sues - ceo - for - defamation - alleges - tesla - breached - contracts/ 164 Ucilia Wang, \u2018Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk Rebuts Claims by Martin Eberhard\u2019, Greentech Media, 22 June 2009, http://www.greentechmedia.com /a rt ic l e s/read/teslas - elon - musk - rebuts - claims -\\\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_20]\", annotations=None), TextContent(type=\\'text\\', text=\\'Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012\u2019, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 29 Ibid. 12 property rights or for other reasons.\u2019 [30] The company also noted that \u2018the costs associated with enforcing patents, confidentiality and invention agreements or other intellectual property rights may make aggressive enforcement impracticable.\u2019 [31] Tesla Motors was also aware that \u2018current and future competitors may independently develop similar technology, duplicate our vehicles or design new vehicles in a way that circumvents our patents.\u2019 [32] Tesla Motors admitted that \u2018The status of patents involves complex legal and factual questions and the breadth of claims allowed is uncertain\u2019. [33] The company was also conscious: \u2018In addition, patents issued to us may be infringed upon or designed around by others and others may obtain patents that we need to license or design around, either of which would increase costs and may adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\u2019 [34] Such reservations are an important context for the announcement in 2014. In his blog post in 2014, Elon Musk of Tesla Motors discussed his growing disenchantment with the patent system: When I started out with my first company, Zip2, I thought patents were a good thing and worked hard to obtain them. And maybe they were good long ago, but too often these days they serve merely to stifle progress, entrench the positions of giant corporations and enrich those in the legal profession, rather than the actual inventors. After Zip2, when I realized that receiving a patent really just meant that you bought a lottery ticket to a lawsuit, I avoided them whenever possible.

Elon Musk noted that Tesla Motors, at first, sought to build a significant patent portfolio: \u2018At Tesla, however, we felt compelled to create patents out of concern that the big car companies would copy our technology and then use their massive manufacturing, sales and marketing power to overwhelm Tesla\u2019. [36] The company developed a significant portfolio of patents in respect of electric cars and associated infrastructure. Elon Musk observed, though, that such an assumption was incorrect: \u2018The unfortunate reality is the opposite: electric car programs (or programs for any vehicle that doesn\u2019t burn hydrocarbons) at the major manufacturers are small to non-existent, constituting an average of far less than 1% of their total vehicle sales.\u2019 [37] He lamented: \u2018At best, the large automakers are producing electric cars with limited range in limited volume\u2019. [38] Musk observed that some automobile manufacturers produced \u2018no zero emission cars at all\u2019. [39] Tesla Motors has been involved in a number of legal skirmishes in respect of intellectual property. In a 2013 dispute, Tesla Motors was involved in a skirmish with pointSET.

In its annual report for 2012, the company summarizes its business operations: We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We own our sales and service network and have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers. We are the first company to commercially produce a federally-compliant electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, which achieves a market-leading range on a single charge combined with attractive design, driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions. As of December 31, 2012, we had delivered approximately 2,450 Tesla Roadsters to customers in over 30 countries. While we have concluded the production run of the Tesla Roadster, its proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system is the foundation of our business. We modified this system for our Model S sedan and plan to continue to enhance it for use in our future electric vehicles, including our Model X crossover. [1] The company notes that \u2018the commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric vehicle that meets consumers\u2019 range and performance expectations requires substantial design, engineering, and integration work on almost every system of our vehicles\u2019.

SolarCity is now the leading provider of solar power systems in the United States. Prior to SpaceX, Elon co-founded PayPal, the world's leading Internet payment system, and served as the company's Chairman and CEO. Before PayPal, Mr. Musk co-founded Zip2, a provider of Internet software to the media industry.

There are also striking synergies between his various ventures. Tesla Motors is reinforced by such infrastructure projects as SolarCity [6] and the Gigafactory. [7] Traditionally, Tesla Motors had professed to take a strict approach to the protection of intellectual property. In 2012, the company observed: \u2018Our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties.\u2019 [8] Tesla Motors warned: Any failure to protect our proprietary rights adequately could result in our competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in the loss of some of our competitive advantage and a decrease in our revenue which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. We have also received from third parties patent licenses related to manufacturing our vehicles. [9] The strategy of the company was to rely upon a combination of patent law, and other intellectual property rights, to protect the core technology of the company. 6 SolarCity, http://www.solarcity.com/company/team 7 Tesla Motors, \u2018Gigafactory\u2019, 26 February 2014, http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/gigafactory 8 Tesla Motors, \u2018Annual Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012\u2019, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 9 Ibid. 4 On the 12th June 2014, Elon Musk, the chief executive officer of the electric car manufacturer, Tesla Motors, announced in a blog that \u2018all our patents belong to you.\u2019 [10] He explained that the company would adopt an open source philosophy in respect of its intellectual property in order to encourage the development of the industry of electric cars, and address the carbon crisis. Elon Musk made the dramatic, landmark announcement: Yesterday, there was a wall of Tesla patents in the lobby of our Palo Alto headquarters. That is no longer the case. They have been removed, in the spirit of the open source movement, for the advancement of electric vehicle technology. [11] Elon Musk observed that \u2018Tesla Motors was created to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport.\u2019 [12] He maintained: \u2018If we clear a path to the creation of compelling electric vehicles, but then lay intellectual property landmines\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_1]\", annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text=\"out that on our track it would run out after just 55 miles and if it does run out, it is not a quick job to charge it up again.\u2019 [160] Tesla Motors pleaded that there had been libel and malicious falsehood. The British Courts were sceptical of such claims. In the Court of Appeals, Lord Moore-Bick observed: \u2018In my view the case pleaded in support of the claim for special damages is, to say the least, very thin on its own terms\u2019. [161] He commented: \u2018Moreover, on the basis of the material currently before the court I do not think that there is any real prospect of Tesla's being able to demonstrate at trial that it has suffered any quantifiable loss by reason of any of the actionable statements.\u2019 [162] http://www.afr.com/p/marketing/chinese _ trademark _ squatters _ have _ ABq1XbD3mSTQMiWicm38PO and Kim Lester, \u2018Penfolds, Tesla, and Apple: Trade Mark Squatting in China\u2019, Drive, ABC 666 Radio, 16 July 2014. 158 Jess Collen, \u2018Tesla's Trademark Problems In China Are Hardly Electrifying News\u2019, *Forbes*, 7 July 2014, http://www.bloomberg.com/new s /2 0 1 4- 07 - 07/tesla - sued - in - china - for - trademark - infringement.html 159 *Tesla Motors Ltd & Anor* v *British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)* [2013] EWCA Civ 152 (05 March 2013) 160 Ibid. 161 Ibid. 162 Ibid. 41 There has also been a conflict over defamation and contract law between Martin Eberhard, one of the founders of Tesla Motors, and its current CEO, Elon Musk. [163] Musk has denied that Eberhard was the inventor of Tesla, claiming \u2018he had no technology of his own, he did not have a prototype and he owned no intellectual property relating to electric cars.\u2019 [164] **5.** **Sustainable Transportation, Clean Technology, and Climate Change** In his address, Elon Musk emphasized the need to build clean technologies to address the problem of climate change. He observed: \u2018Given that annual new vehicle production is approaching 100 million per year and the global fleet is approximately 2 billion cars, it is impossible for Tesla to build electric cars fast enough to address the carbon crisis.\u2019 Musk recognised: \u2018By the same token, it means the market is enormous.\u2019 [ 165] He maintained: \u2018Our true competition is not the small trickle of non-Tesla electric cars being produced, but rather the enormous flood of gasoline cars pouring out of the world\u2019s factories every day.\u2019 [166] Musk commented that there was a need to develop the innovation ecology in respect of electric cars: \u2018We believe that Tesla, other companies making electric cars, and the world would all benefit from a common, rapidly-evolving technology platform.\u2019 [167] 163 Eric Lane, \u2018Roadster Rage: Tesla Founder Sues CEO for Defamation; Alleges Tesla Breached - Contracts\u2019, *The Green Patent Blog*, 28 June 2009, http://www.greenpatentblog.com/2009/06/28/roadster rage tesla - founder - sues - ceo - for - defamation - alleges - tesla - breached - contracts/ 164 Ucilia Wang, \u2018Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk Rebuts Claims by Martin Eberhard\u2019, Greentech Media, 22 June 2009, http://www.greentechmedia.com /a rt ic l e s/read/teslas - elon - musk - rebuts - claims -\\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_20]\", annotations=None), TextContent(type='text', text='Report for the Fiscal Period ended December 31, 2012\u2019, http://ir.teslamotors.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID = 1193125 - 13 - 96241&CIK = 1318605 29 Ibid. 12 property rights or for other reasons.\u2019 [30] The company also noted that \u2018the costs associated with enforcing patents, confidentiality and invention agreements or other intellectual property rights may make aggressive enforcement impracticable.\u2019 [31] Tesla Motors was also aware that \u2018current and future competitors may independently develop similar technology, duplicate our vehicles or design new vehicles in a way that circumvents our patents.\u2019 [32] Tesla Motors admitted that \u2018The status of patents involves complex legal and factual questions and the breadth of claims allowed is uncertain\u2019. [33] The company was also conscious: \u2018In addition, patents issued to us may be infringed upon or designed around by others and others may obtain patents that we need to license or design around, either of which would increase costs and may adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\u2019 [34] Such reservations are an important context for the announcement in 2014. In his blog post in 2014, Elon Musk of Tesla Motors discussed his growing disenchantment with the patent system: When I started out with my first company, Zip2, I thought patents were a good thing and worked hard to obtain them. And maybe they were good long ago, but too often these days they serve merely to stifle progress, entrench the positions of giant corporations and enrich those in the legal profession, rather than the actual inventors. After Zip2, when I realized that receiving a patent really just meant that you bought a lottery ticket to a lawsuit, I avoided them whenever possible.

Elon Musk noted that Tesla Motors, at first, sought to build a significant patent portfolio: \u2018At Tesla, however, we felt compelled to create patents out of concern that the big car companies would copy our technology and then use their massive manufacturing, sales and marketing power to overwhelm Tesla\u2019. [36] The company developed a significant portfolio of patents in respect of electric cars and associated infrastructure. Elon Musk observed, though, that such an assumption was incorrect: \u2018The unfortunate reality is the opposite: electric car programs (or programs for any vehicle that doesn\u2019t burn hydrocarbons) at the major manufacturers are small to non-existent, constituting an average of far less than 1% of their total vehicle sales.\u2019 [37] He lamented: \u2018At best, the large automakers are producing electric cars with limited range in limited volume\u2019. [38] Musk observed that some automobile manufacturers produced \u2018no zero emission cars at all\u2019.

Transitioning to a sustainable energy economy, in which electric vehicles play a pivotal role, has been one of his central interests for almost two decades, stemming from his time as a physics student working on ultracapacitors in Silicon Valley. At SpaceX, Elon is the chief designer, overseeing development of\n[Source: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer.pdf, ID: Tesla_Motors_IP_Open_Innovation_and_the_Carbon_Crisis_-_Matthew_Rimmer_0]"

He wondered whether the move would undercut the value of Tesla Motors. Totaro argued that Musk could do more if he was truly committed to an open source model: \u2018If Mr. Musk would be willing to redistribute his wealth to the employees and investors who made the commitment to create value for the company in the first place, then this move to open source their patents during the formative stages of the EV industry might make more sense.\u2019 [66] It should also be noted that Tesla Motors has not abandoned its intellectual property entirely. he company has only offered access for \u2018good faith\u2019 uses of its patents \u2014 which still leaves open the prospect of the company taking action against \u2018bad faith\u2019 uses of its patents.

He wondered whether the move would undercut the value of Tesla Motors. Totaro argued that Musk could do more if he was truly committed to an open source model: \u2018If Mr. Musk would be willing to redistribute his wealth to the employees and investors who made the commitment to create value for the company in the first place, then this move to open source their patents during the formative stages of the EV industry might make more sense.\u2019 [66] It should also be noted that Tesla Motors has not abandoned its intellectual property entirely. he company has only offered access for \u2018good faith\u2019 uses of its patents \u2014 which still leaves open the prospect of the company taking action against \u2018bad faith\u2019 uses of its patents. Professor Orly Lobel from the University of San Diego commented: \u2018There\u2019s a lot of thinking in the research these days on the gap between the codified knowledge that is patentable and gets disclosed versus tacit knowledge that really exists in how you actually produce\u2019. [67] She noted: \u2018That gap is probably relevant in this market.\u2019 [68] Her work has particularly the importance of the use of confidential information and non-disclosure agreements in Silicon Valley.

[70] In his address, Elon Musk commented: \u2018We believe that applying the open source philosophy to our patents will strengthen rather than diminish Tesla\u2019s position in this regard.\u2019 [ 71] The use of open source strategies to encourage collaboration and disseminate new technologies has a long tradition.
